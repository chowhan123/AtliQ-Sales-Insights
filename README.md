## Data Analysis Using SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### 2. Show total number of customers

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
```

### 3. Show transactions for Chennai market (Market Code: Mark001)

```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
```

### 4. Show distinct product codes sold in Chennai

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
```

### 5. Show transactions where currency is US dollars

```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';
```

### 6. Show transactions from 2020 (joined with date table)

```sql
SELECT transactions.*, date.*
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date
WHERE date.year = 2020;
```

### 7. Show total revenue in 2020

```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount)
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date
WHERE date.year = 2020 AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');
```

### 8. Show total revenue in January 2020

```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount)
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date
WHERE date.year = 2020 AND date.month_name = 'January' AND (transactions.currency = 'INR' OR transactions.currency = 'USD');
```

### 9. Show total revenue in Chennai in 2020

```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount)
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date
WHERE date.year = 2020 AND transactions.market_code = 'Mark001';

## Data Transformation Using Power BI

### Formula to Create `norm_amount` Column

To normalize sales values based on currency:

```powerquery
= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)
```

This Power Query formula converts USD to INR using a multiplier (e.g., ₹1 = \$75) for comparative analysis.
